## Reporting a Bug

The `ISAC-SIMO` team and community take all security bugs in `ISAC-SIMO` seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of `ISAC-SIMO`. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the Security Team at security@buildchange.org.

The security team will acknowledge your email as soon as possible, and will send a
more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    deployed in production and released as fast as possible to all maintained
    versions of `ISAC-SIMO`.
